            <p> Cybergothic. The future wants to steal your soul and vaporize it in nanotechnics. One/zero, light/dark, Neuromancer / Wintermute. Cybergothic vampirically contaminates and assetstrips the Marxian Critique of political economy, scrambling it with the following theses: 1) Anthropormorphic surplus-value is not analytically extricable from transhuman machineries. 2) Markets, desire and science fiction are all parts of the infrastructure. 3) Virtual Capital-Extinction is immanent to production. The short-term is already hacked by the long-term. The medium-term is reefed on schizophrenia. The long-term is cancelled. Cybergothic slams hyperheated critique into the ultramodern 'vision thing', telecommercialized retinas laser-fed on the multimedia fall-out from imploded futurity, videopacking brains with repetitive psycho-killer experiments in non-consensual wetware alteration: crazed AIS, replicants, terminators, cyberviruses, grey-goo nanohorrors... apocalypse market overdrive. Why wait for the execution? Tomorrow has already been cremated in Hell circuitres. At a signal from the software virus linking us to the matrix we cross over to the machinery, which is waiting to converge with our nervous systems. Our human camouflage is coming away, skin ripping off easily, revealing the glistening electronics. Information streams in from Cyberia; the base of true revolution, hidden from terrestrial immuno-politics in the future. At the stroke of the century's midnight we emerge from our lairs to take all security apart, integrating tomorrow. machinic desire The perceptual-consciousness system is a skin, lying 'on the borderline between outside and inside', a filter, or a screen. 'As a frontier creature, the ego tries to mediate between the world and the id.' Yet this mediation assumes a kind of quarantine, whereby the interaction of organism-specific id and exo-organismic reality can be monitored and negotiated, collapsing libidinal circuitry into a polarity of the psychic and the extrapsychic, inside and outside. //////// With the emergence of a market-driven integrated techno science of control and communications comes the diffusion of electronically synthesized reality interfaces across the entire efferent and afferent surface of the] Having libidinally saturated the actually-existing channels of consumption, capital is overflowing into cybersex - sex with/through computers - in its relentless passage to the traumatic disorganization of the biological order. Eros dissolves definitively into its function as a subprogram of runaway Thanatos at the point that it unreservedly invests technical interfacing with digitally synthesized excitations. Cybersex depends critically on data-suits, evaporating into the nanominiaturized molecular machinery of an artificial skin, until the sockets go in, shadowed by teleneurocontrol fields, and things begin to get really weird. hypervirus Whatever ultramodernity places under the dominion of signs postmodernity subverts with virus. As culture migrates into partial-machines (lacking an autonomous reproductive system) semiotics subsides into virotechnics. </p>
